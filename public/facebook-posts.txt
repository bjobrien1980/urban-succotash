Your super payments increase from today!
From 1 July, the Superannuation Guarantee increases to 12%, which means your employer must pay 12% of your ordinary earnings into your nominated super account at least every three months. 
It was unions that first won super for every worker back in the 1980s, and ever since we've fought to defend and strengthen your access to super, so you can have a comfortable and dignified retirement after a lifetime of work. 
EVERY worker in Australia is entitled to superannuation, please check your super account every quarter to make sure you're being paid fairly! And if you're not being paid your super, please reach out to your delegate or organiser.

The ETU WA Branch has filed two regulated labour hire arrangement order applications today in the FWC, seeking that Ventia entities on Chevron facilities be entitled to same pay as Chevron Techs.
Chevron are renowned for playing contractors off against one another seeking the lowest pay rates possible, so this should set the cat amongst the pigeons!
Well done to all those involved in this initiative!
If you don’t fight, you lose!

ALSTOM EA WIN
The initial offer from Alstom saw workers receiving 6.5% over three years, underpinning the manufacturing award, drop in afternoon shift allowance, change to overtime allowance and removal of RDO’s.
After 14 negotiation meetings and being in the commission (pressured by the company), workers won 16% over 3 years, (9% year 1, 3.5% in years 2 and 3), monthly RDO’s, no changes to afternoon shift allowance and overtime and they managed to improve wording within the agreement to make it clearer and more beneficial for the workers.
Membership density also grew on site from 15% to 90% across both the AMWU and ETU.
Well done comrades. You stood strong and held your ground for the outcome you deserved ✊✊✊

Hello Readers
It’s great to be back in the driver’s seat after an incredible holiday in the UK. I return with a renewed determination to continue strengthening our Union and building power among our members working across the four major mining companies.
One of our ongoing responsibilities as Union members is helping those who’ve never had to fight for their conditions understand that the hard-won standards, pay, and protections we enjoy today have always come from collective effort and struggle.
That reality hasn’t changed — and it won’t. But what we can do is keep finding smarter, more effective ways to stand up together.
There is power in the Union.

In recent interview the CEO of Pilbara Ports went on about how the workforce was “homogeneous” and that they needed more gender equity in the workplace, even though the workforce was already 42% women the CEO felt that didn’t go far enough to bridge the gap between men and women, recently elevating three women into Port management roles. 
The MUA fully support women working in the Maritime sector and were campaigning for equal pay for women long before it became legislated in the 1970’s, though what we don’t support is employees doing the same job on different rates of pay.
If the CEO were so concerned about gender equity he would at least ensure that women get paid the same as their counterparts on site. there are currently a number of women and men in Port Authority roles that get paid substantially less than their counterparts.
It’s obvious the company only care about gender equity when it suits them, that is to say when they stage another PR stunt on how much they purport to care. 
All Men and Women working at Pilbara Ports should be on the same rate of pay for work of equal and comparable value and we will continue to press this issue until a solution is found!

Last week, Vertech gave their Inspector and Rope Access oil and gas workforce notice of their 3rd EA Ballot since March this year.
Vertech are clearly slow learners.
There has been zero improvement in the rates of pay or conditions of employment since their last EA offer ,
Vertech’s latest EA proposal rips off even more conditions off workers than their last dud deal.
Vertech, who are paying up to $17 per hour less than industry standards, now want to block the level progression for NDT Inspectors even where the Inspectors have achieved all required competencies and standards.
And they want the ability to rip off every travel entitlement currently paid to workers the day after Fair Work approve their dodgy EA.
The Offshore Alliance are encouraging all Inspectors to Vote ‘NO’ to Vertech’s sub-standard EA and continue the Protected Industrial Action which is currently in place on all Vertech facilities.
IF YOU DON’T FIGHT, YOU LOSE!
