Your super payments increase from today!
From 1 July, the Superannuation Guarantee increases to 12%, which means your employer must pay 12% of your ordinary earnings into your nominated super account at least every three months. 
It was unions that first won super for every worker back in the 1980s, and ever since we've fought to defend and strengthen your access to super, so you can have a comfortable and dignified retirement after a lifetime of work. 
EVERY worker in Australia is entitled to superannuation, please check your super account every quarter to make sure you're being paid fairly! And if you're not being paid your super, please reach out to your delegate or organiser.

The ETU WA Branch has filed two regulated labour hire arrangement order applications today in the FWC, seeking that Ventia entities on Chevron facilities be entitled to same pay as Chevron Techs.
Chevron are renowned for playing contractors off against one another seeking the lowest pay rates possible, so this should set the cat amongst the pigeons!
Well done to all those involved in this initiative!
If you don’t fight, you lose!

ALSTOM EA WIN
The initial offer from Alstom saw workers receiving 6.5% over three years, underpinning the manufacturing award, drop in afternoon shift allowance, change to overtime allowance and removal of RDO’s.
After 14 negotiation meetings and being in the commission (pressured by the company), workers won 16% over 3 years, (9% year 1, 3.5% in years 2 and 3), monthly RDO’s, no changes to afternoon shift allowance and overtime and they managed to improve wording within the agreement to make it clearer and more beneficial for the workers.
Membership density also grew on site from 15% to 90% across both the AMWU and ETU.
Well done comrades. You stood strong and held your ground for the outcome you deserved ✊✊✊
