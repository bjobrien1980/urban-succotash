Your super payments increase from today!
From 1 July, the Superannuation Guarantee increases to 12%, which means your employer must pay 12% of your ordinary earnings into your nominated super account at least every three months. 
It was unions that first won super for every worker back in the 1980s, and ever since we've fought to defend and strengthen your access to super, so you can have a comfortable and dignified retirement after a lifetime of work. 
EVERY worker in Australia is entitled to superannuation, please check your super account every quarter to make sure you're being paid fairly! And if you're not being paid your super, please reach out to your delegate or organiser.

The ETU WA Branch has filed two regulated labour hire arrangement order applications today in the FWC, seeking that Ventia entities on Chevron facilities be entitled to same pay as Chevron Techs.
Chevron are renowned for playing contractors off against one another seeking the lowest pay rates possible, so this should set the cat amongst the pigeons!

ALSTOM EA WIN
The initial offer from Alstom saw workers receiving 6.5% over three years, underpinning the manufacturing award, drop in afternoon shift allowance, change to overtime allowance and removal of RDO’s.
After 14 negotiation meetings and being in the commission (pressured by the company), workers won 16% over 3 years, (9% year 1, 3.5% in years 2 and 3), monthly RDO’s, no changes to afternoon shift allowance and overtime and they managed to improve wording within the agreement to make it clearer and more beneficial for the workers.
Membership density also grew on site from 15% to 90% across both the AMWU and ETU.
Well done comrades. You stood strong and held your ground for the outcome you deserved ✊✊✊

Hello Readers
It’s great to be back in the driver’s seat after an incredible holiday in the UK. I return with a renewed determination to continue strengthening our Union and building power among our members working across the four major mining companies.
One of our ongoing responsibilities as Union members is helping those who’ve never had to fight for their conditions understand that the hard-won standards, pay, and protections we enjoy today have always come from collective effort and struggle.
That reality hasn’t changed — and it won’t. But what we can do is keep finding smarter, more effective ways to stand up together.
There is power in the Union.

In recent interview the CEO of Pilbara Ports went on about how the workforce was “homogeneous” and that they needed more gender equity in the workplace, even though the workforce was already 42% women the CEO felt that didn’t go far enough to bridge the gap between men and women, recently elevating three women into Port management roles. 
The MUA fully support women working in the Maritime sector and were campaigning for equal pay for women long before it became legislated in the 1970’s, though what we don’t support is employees doing the same job on different rates of pay.
If the CEO were so concerned about gender equity he would at least ensure that women get paid the same as their counterparts on site. there are currently a number of women and men in Port Authority roles that get paid substantially less than their counterparts.
It’s obvious the company only care about gender equity when it suits them, that is to say when they stage another PR stunt on how much they purport to care. 
All Men and Women working at Pilbara Ports should be on the same rate of pay for work of equal and comparable value and we will continue to press this issue until a solution is found!

Last week, Vertech gave their Inspector and Rope Access oil and gas workforce notice of their 3rd EA Ballot since March this year.
Vertech are clearly slow learners.
There has been zero improvement in the rates of pay or conditions of employment since their last EA offer ,
Vertech’s latest EA proposal rips off even more conditions off workers than their last dud deal.
Vertech, who are paying up to $17 per hour less than industry standards, now want to block the level progression for NDT Inspectors even where the Inspectors have achieved all required competencies and standards.
And they want the ability to rip off every travel entitlement currently paid to workers the day after Fair Work approve their dodgy EA.
The Offshore Alliance are encouraging all Inspectors to Vote ‘NO’ to Vertech’s sub-standard EA and continue the Protected Industrial Action which is currently in place on all Vertech facilities.
IF YOU DON’T FIGHT, YOU LOSE!

Over the past few months, the WMWA has been working with members and obtained over 450 petitions supporting workers having a real say in their pay and conditions through collective bargaining at Paraburdoo.
WMWA and our members understood that there were just over 800 non-management employees at the Paraburdoo Operations' four mine sites.
Rio has submitted to the FWC they believe there are some 990 non-management roles at Paraburdoo Operations 4 mine sites, which means our 450 petition signatures are not quite enough.
The WMWA won't give up on giving our members a real say about their pay and conditions, and we will work with Para members to ensure we get 550-plus petitions in our next application.

Today the ballot opens for MUA CBH members to engage in protected action to advance their claims during these current EBA negotiations.
We are asking all members to vote YES to all questions in the ballot.
Negotiations have been slow going with CBH failing to provide any counter proposals to the table for months! Simply saying that the claims put forward by the workforce are not realistic, while at the same time putting forward claims themselves asking for roster changes, reduction of number of meal breaks, and multiple claims aimed at ripping back the wins made by the membership during the last EBA.
This position by CBH has led the members to make the decision to head towards protected action and hold a vote for PABO.
What have CBH done to try and get the ball rolling on negotiations with protected action looming? They have finally put forward a counter offer to the membership that falls far below the mark of any sane company.
CBH has put the forward the offer of:
• No MUA claims accepted
• All CBH claims accepted
• 2% each year for three years
When even the basic calculations have been done, this offer put forward by CBH, after factoring in the roster changes and loss of other entitlements, would leave the operators with a pay rise that comes to only a couple hundred dollars total over the life of the agreement! And on the maintenance side, it would still leave the members roughly 10% behind the rates being paid to maintenance workers at other sites within CBH itself!
This offer is unbelievable and shows CBH are currently living in a fantasy land if they think MUA members are going to accept such an insulting offer. 
It seems CBH have to be shown how serious the membership at CBH are about achieving proper wage rises and conditions and the members will be more than happy to show them during this ballot.

📢📢📢WesTrac: Record Profits, at the Expense of Workers 📢📢📢
Industrial services are thriving. Demand is rising. WesTrac has committed to future growth with massive investments in inventory, infrastructure, and advanced technology.
CEO J.E. Croome received $4.36 million in total remuneration* in 2024 alone. So why are the workers told there's "no money" for decent pay rises? 😡
The Real Story: Workers Missing Out
While the company celebrates soaring profits their workers face stagnant wages and increased cost of living.
WesTrac wouldn’t exist without its skilled, dedicated workforce, the engine behind the company’s success, yet they’re being left behind.
WesTrac can afford decent pay rises, they’ve proven that with their books. It’s time they prove it with action.

Woodside’s offer to NRC employees to have a ‘sit down chat’ with Woodside’s lawyers prior to them meeting with NOPSEMA’s investigators investigating the fatality of Michael Jurman, doesn’t pass the pub test.
Woodside’s lawyers are there to represent the corporate interests of Woodside. Not workers.
If Woodside were genuine about ensuring that their NRC workforce had legal representation, they should have paid for employees to get independent legal representation.
Woodside's offer of legal support from a Woodside's offer has been made with the undertone that employees are best off taking up Woodside's 'offer'.
It's an offer which is "too good to refuse".
The Offshore Alliance is not going to back away from its campaign to ensure that Vertech and Woodside are made accountable for the death of one of our members on the North Rankin platform.
We want to thank everyone who has sent information about Vertech’s lack of OHS compliance through to the Union as this is entirely relevant in demonstrating their appalling OH&S culture.

The fatality of Michael Jurman on Woodside’s NRC Platform was tragic for so many reasons, but entirely avoidable.
But the recent near-decapitation of a Rope Access worker on Rio Tinto’s Parker Point Stage 2 Wharf Pile Structural Integrity Scope Project just 8 weeks ago, shows that Vertech haven’t learnt a thing.
Over the last fortnight, the Offshore Alliance have been inundated with reports and feedback about Vertech’s safety culture – or lack thereof.
In early May 2025, a Vertech Rope Access worker was within 100mm of being decapitated at Parker Point by 350kg of chain which had projected from a vessel below the affected worker. 
This incident was not reported to Rio Tinto, Worksafe or IRATA and the employee who reported the incident to the Senior Vertech management working at Parker Point and in Vertech’s Perth HQ was terminated by Vertech due to a ‘lack of work’.
This is not just completely off tap, it demands an investigation and decisive action taken against the management concerned and Vertech as the Company concerned.
We have reproduced below the complaint (with names redacted) the OA has made to Worksafe and Rio Tinto.
In fairness to Rio (who were not made aware of the incident by Vertech), they have had the foresight and decency to get in contact with the Union and emphasize that they are treating this incident with the utmost seriousness.
The OA will be wanting the strongest possible action be taken against Vertech for the unreported near decapitation of a worker on Rio's Wharf project.
We cannot allow workers to be cannon fodder for companies who have a rip and bust approach to work and zero regard for the health and safety of workers.
Subject matter experts need to be employed by the resource companies to oversee the workscopes of contractors, and adopt a zero tolerance for breaches of fundamental safety standards.
Vertech are not fit to work on major resource projects whilst they continue to treat workers as expendable units of production.
The safety of workers must come first.
The Offshore Alliance Report to Worksafe is below:
-----------------------------------------------------------
On 03 May 2025, there was a near fatality on Rio Tinto’s Parker Point Stage 2 Wharf Pile Structural Integrity Scope Project when a Vertech employee was within 100mm of being decapitated by 350kg of chain which had projected from a vessel below the affected worker. 
This incident was not reported to Rio Tinto, Worksafe or IRATA and the employee who reported the incident to the Vertech XXX plus Vertech’s XXX Manager and to Vertech’s XXX Manager, was subsequently terminated by Vertech.
The day prior to the near fatality (02 May 2025), the Parker Point shiploader hit one of the air compressors being used by the Vertech Rope Access Technicians. 
The air compressor door which had been left open was destroyed, making it unsafe to use. 
The job should have been stopped at this point to ensure proper planning so that all further tasks could be completed safety.
On the day of the near fatality (03 May 2025), Vertech had to get air to the 750 kg air hoists to complete the rigging task. 
There was no lift plan to lift the air hoists out of the vessel which was also being used to double up as Rio Tinto’s FRC, but Vertech went ahead with the lift anyway. 
Because there were no airlines long enough to reach due to the compressor being damaged and unserviceable, Vertech decided to lift the block head with a rope access sling so they could complete the task. 
Rope access slings should never be mixed with rigging equipment. When Vertech commenced lifting the block head, it created a loop of stored energy in the excess chain. 
This suddenly let go and the remainder of the 350kg chain flew out of the vessel, missing the head of a Vertech Rope Access Technician by 100mm.
The Union is appalled to find that the near fatality at Paker Point was not reported to Rio Tinto or any of the regulatory authorities. 
The Offshore Alliance is seeking an urgent investigation of this incident by Worksafe WA and can provide the details of personnel willing to speak to Worksafe about the incident.
There are numerous other incidents leading up to the near-fatality which had not been reported by Vertech to Rio Tinto and the Offshore Alliance has ongoing concerns for the health and safety of all workers employed on the Parker Point Stage 2 Wharf Pile Structural Integrity Scope Project.

In bargaining with Qube last year on behalf of our Prelude logistics members, the Offshore Alliance served Qube with a claim for a 55% increase in wages, along with improved employment conditions.
The reason for our claim was very clear. 
55% is close to the wage cuts which were ripped off Prelude Stores and MLC workers when Shell sacked their logistics workforce in 2021-22 and brought in Qube Offshore on low-wage common law contracts.
To the credit of our Prelude Logistics members, they got organised and took the fight up to Qube with 4 months of Protected Industrial Action, late last year and into early 2025.
This dispute cost Qube several hundred thousand dollars in additional costs in their efforts to use untrained scab labour, and cost Shell a shitload more in lost productivity and delayed projects.
Commencing next Monday, the Offshore Alliance have a 3-day Hearing before the Fair Work Commission where we are seeking a Determination from the Commission requiring Qube to pay OA members the pay claims we are seeking for our Qube Offshore members.
The Offshore Alliance has one of the country’s best industrial barristers (Phil Boncardo) running our case, ably supported by OA lawyer Jess Duane.
Our union will never back away from taking the fight up to employers on the job and in the Courts to improve the pay and conditions of our members.

Despite the new EBA being a Greenfield Agreement, our members had full involvement in the development of our log of claims, the negotiation of the Agreement and the agreed bargaining outcomes.

After months and months of denial by Chevron about their intention to sack hundreds of Australian engineers and replace them with cheap exploited labour from India, they have now announced the loss of 300-400 jobs.
Chevron are an absolute disgrace and they have demonstrated complete contempt for their highly skilled West Australian workforce in Elizabeth Quay (and we aren't talking about their HR bosses in this statement).
-------------------------
Article written by Matt McKenzie and published in the West Australian
American oil and gas giant Chevron is wielding the axe on hundreds of WA jobs after months of speculation.
There will be two waves of redundancies in the Australian operations, with the first group of staff notified in the past two weeks. They will exit on July 31.
A second wave will follow later in the September quarter and has not yet been finalised.
Chevron’s Australian operations are headquartered in Perth and the company runs the giant Gorgon and Wheatstone gas export plants in the Pilbara.
It was among the largest foreign investors into WA’s resources industry, and the business earned $17 billion of revenue in 2024. Profit was $US5.2b ($9bn).
The company had already signalled plans to cut about 15 to 20 per cent of its global staff — and it is broadly expected a similar slice of the 2000-strong Australian workforce will be on the chopping block.
That would be about 300 to 400 jobs across the two redundancy waves.
A spokesman for Chevron said the business was “taking action to simplify our organisational structure, execute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness”.
The business is chasing $US2b ($3b) to $US3b of structural cost cuts by the end of next year.
“In line with these goals, changes to our organisational structure are being made, and these are likely to result in a reduction of 15 to 20 per cent in our global workforce, including a reduction to our Australian workforce,” he said.
“Our priority is to support our employees through this process with respect and care. We will seek to redeploy people within the company where possible, and we will provide severance and career transition services when required.”
The West Australian first reported the looming job losses in November last year when former chief Mark Hatfield confirmed the company’s workforce was under review.
He said no final decisions had been made at the time.
That was in addition to an international process which was to consider moving jobs to a “global capability centre” offshore in the Indian city of Bangalore.

Earlier this week Paid Parental Leave increased to 24 weeks 🎉
Thanks to legislation passed by the Federal Labor Government in 2023, Paid Parental Leave has been gradually rising - from 18 weeks to a full 26 weeks by 2026.
This milestone wouldn’t be possible without the advocacy of Union movement, who’ve long championed better entitlements for working parents across Australia. 💪

Standing strong!
MEU members at Metropolitan mine near Helensburgh are resisting Peabody's attempts to strip their longstanding job security clause in their upcoming EA. 
They've been locked out for 15 days, but are as determined as ever to secure an agreement that protects their job security while also addressing cost of living pressures. 
Send your support to the Helensburgh Lodge!

Recently, National Power Industry Coordinator Ben Schmidt and I hit the road, visiting Horizon Power depots in Port Hedland and Karratha as part of a regional engagement tour. The week prior, Steve also stopped in at the Esperance depot.
Key discussions with members centred on maintaining high safety standards, addressing recent incidents and their impacts, the future of licensing for lineworkers across WA, and gaining insight into the broader national outlook for the power industry.
Carnarvon, Broome and Kununurra – you’re next on the list in the coming weeks.
