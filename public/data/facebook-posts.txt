Your super payments increase from today!
From 1 July, the Superannuation Guarantee increases to 12%, which means your employer must pay 12% of your ordinary earnings into your nominated super account at least every three months. 
It was unions that first won super for every worker back in the 1980s, and ever since we've fought to defend and strengthen your access to super, so you can have a comfortable and dignified retirement after a lifetime of work. 
EVERY worker in Australia is entitled to superannuation, please check your super account every quarter to make sure you're being paid fairly! And if you're not being paid your super, please reach out to your delegate or organiser.

The ETU WA Branch has filed two regulated labour hire arrangement order applications today in the FWC, seeking that Ventia entities on Chevron facilities be entitled to same pay as Chevron Techs.
Chevron are renowned for playing contractors off against one another seeking the lowest pay rates possible, so this should set the cat amongst the pigeons!

ALSTOM EA WIN
The initial offer from Alstom saw workers receiving 6.5% over three years, underpinning the manufacturing award, drop in afternoon shift allowance, change to overtime allowance and removal of RDO’s.
After 14 negotiation meetings and being in the commission (pressured by the company), workers won 16% over 3 years, (9% year 1, 3.5% in years 2 and 3), monthly RDO’s, no changes to afternoon shift allowance and overtime and they managed to improve wording within the agreement to make it clearer and more beneficial for the workers.
Membership density also grew on site from 15% to 90% across both the AMWU and ETU.
Well done comrades. You stood strong and held your ground for the outcome you deserved ✊✊✊

Hello Readers
It’s great to be back in the driver’s seat after an incredible holiday in the UK. I return with a renewed determination to continue strengthening our Union and building power among our members working across the four major mining companies.
One of our ongoing responsibilities as Union members is helping those who’ve never had to fight for their conditions understand that the hard-won standards, pay, and protections we enjoy today have always come from collective effort and struggle.
That reality hasn’t changed — and it won’t. But what we can do is keep finding smarter, more effective ways to stand up together.
There is power in the Union.

In recent interview the CEO of Pilbara Ports went on about how the workforce was “homogeneous” and that they needed more gender equity in the workplace, even though the workforce was already 42% women the CEO felt that didn’t go far enough to bridge the gap between men and women, recently elevating three women into Port management roles. 
The MUA fully support women working in the Maritime sector and were campaigning for equal pay for women long before it became legislated in the 1970’s, though what we don’t support is employees doing the same job on different rates of pay.
If the CEO were so concerned about gender equity he would at least ensure that women get paid the same as their counterparts on site. there are currently a number of women and men in Port Authority roles that get paid substantially less than their counterparts.
It’s obvious the company only care about gender equity when it suits them, that is to say when they stage another PR stunt on how much they purport to care. 
All Men and Women working at Pilbara Ports should be on the same rate of pay for work of equal and comparable value and we will continue to press this issue until a solution is found!

Last week, Vertech gave their Inspector and Rope Access oil and gas workforce notice of their 3rd EA Ballot since March this year.
Vertech are clearly slow learners.
There has been zero improvement in the rates of pay or conditions of employment since their last EA offer ,
Vertech’s latest EA proposal rips off even more conditions off workers than their last dud deal.
Vertech, who are paying up to $17 per hour less than industry standards, now want to block the level progression for NDT Inspectors even where the Inspectors have achieved all required competencies and standards.
And they want the ability to rip off every travel entitlement currently paid to workers the day after Fair Work approve their dodgy EA.
The Offshore Alliance are encouraging all Inspectors to Vote ‘NO’ to Vertech’s sub-standard EA and continue the Protected Industrial Action which is currently in place on all Vertech facilities.
IF YOU DON’T FIGHT, YOU LOSE!

Over the past few months, the WMWA has been working with members and obtained over 450 petitions supporting workers having a real say in their pay and conditions through collective bargaining at Paraburdoo.
WMWA and our members understood that there were just over 800 non-management employees at the Paraburdoo Operations' four mine sites.
Rio has submitted to the FWC they believe there are some 990 non-management roles at Paraburdoo Operations 4 mine sites, which means our 450 petition signatures are not quite enough.
The WMWA won't give up on giving our members a real say about their pay and conditions, and we will work with Para members to ensure we get 550-plus petitions in our next application.

Today the ballot opens for MUA CBH members to engage in protected action to advance their claims during these current EBA negotiations.
We are asking all members to vote YES to all questions in the ballot.
Negotiations have been slow going with CBH failing to provide any counter proposals to the table for months! Simply saying that the claims put forward by the workforce are not realistic, while at the same time putting forward claims themselves asking for roster changes, reduction of number of meal breaks, and multiple claims aimed at ripping back the wins made by the membership during the last EBA.
This position by CBH has led the members to make the decision to head towards protected action and hold a vote for PABO.
What have CBH done to try and get the ball rolling on negotiations with protected action looming? They have finally put forward a counter offer to the membership that falls far below the mark of any sane company.
CBH has put the forward the offer of:
• No MUA claims accepted
• All CBH claims accepted
• 2% each year for three years
When even the basic calculations have been done, this offer put forward by CBH, after factoring in the roster changes and loss of other entitlements, would leave the operators with a pay rise that comes to only a couple hundred dollars total over the life of the agreement! And on the maintenance side, it would still leave the members roughly 10% behind the rates being paid to maintenance workers at other sites within CBH itself!
This offer is unbelievable and shows CBH are currently living in a fantasy land if they think MUA members are going to accept such an insulting offer. 
It seems CBH have to be shown how serious the membership at CBH are about achieving proper wage rises and conditions and the members will be more than happy to show them during this ballot.

📢📢📢WesTrac: Record Profits, at the Expense of Workers 📢📢📢
Industrial services are thriving. Demand is rising. WesTrac has committed to future growth with massive investments in inventory, infrastructure, and advanced technology.
CEO J.E. Croome received $4.36 million in total remuneration* in 2024 alone. So why are the workers told there's "no money" for decent pay rises? 😡
The Real Story: Workers Missing Out
While the company celebrates soaring profits their workers face stagnant wages and increased cost of living.
WesTrac wouldn’t exist without its skilled, dedicated workforce, the engine behind the company’s success, yet they’re being left behind.
WesTrac can afford decent pay rises, they’ve proven that with their books. It’s time they prove it with action.

Woodside’s offer to NRC employees to have a ‘sit down chat’ with Woodside’s lawyers prior to them meeting with NOPSEMA’s investigators investigating the fatality of Michael Jurman, doesn’t pass the pub test.
Woodside’s lawyers are there to represent the corporate interests of Woodside. Not workers.
If Woodside were genuine about ensuring that their NRC workforce had legal representation, they should have paid for employees to get independent legal representation.
Woodside's offer of legal support from a Woodside's offer has been made with the undertone that employees are best off taking up Woodside's 'offer'.
It's an offer which is "too good to refuse".
The Offshore Alliance is not going to back away from its campaign to ensure that Vertech and Woodside are made accountable for the death of one of our members on the North Rankin platform.
We want to thank everyone who has sent information about Vertech’s lack of OHS compliance through to the Union as this is entirely relevant in demonstrating their appalling OH&S culture.

The fatality of Michael Jurman on Woodside’s NRC Platform was tragic for so many reasons, but entirely avoidable.
But the recent near-decapitation of a Rope Access worker on Rio Tinto’s Parker Point Stage 2 Wharf Pile Structural Integrity Scope Project just 8 weeks ago, shows that Vertech haven’t learnt a thing.
Over the last fortnight, the Offshore Alliance have been inundated with reports and feedback about Vertech’s safety culture – or lack thereof.
In early May 2025, a Vertech Rope Access worker was within 100mm of being decapitated at Parker Point by 350kg of chain which had projected from a vessel below the affected worker. 
This incident was not reported to Rio Tinto, Worksafe or IRATA and the employee who reported the incident to the Senior Vertech management working at Parker Point and in Vertech’s Perth HQ was terminated by Vertech due to a ‘lack of work’.
This is not just completely off tap, it demands an investigation and decisive action taken against the management concerned and Vertech as the Company concerned.
We have reproduced below the complaint (with names redacted) the OA has made to Worksafe and Rio Tinto.
In fairness to Rio (who were not made aware of the incident by Vertech), they have had the foresight and decency to get in contact with the Union and emphasize that they are treating this incident with the utmost seriousness.
The OA will be wanting the strongest possible action be taken against Vertech for the unreported near decapitation of a worker on Rio's Wharf project.
We cannot allow workers to be cannon fodder for companies who have a rip and bust approach to work and zero regard for the health and safety of workers.
Subject matter experts need to be employed by the resource companies to oversee the workscopes of contractors, and adopt a zero tolerance for breaches of fundamental safety standards.
Vertech are not fit to work on major resource projects whilst they continue to treat workers as expendable units of production.
The safety of workers must come first.
The Offshore Alliance Report to Worksafe is below:
-----------------------------------------------------------
On 03 May 2025, there was a near fatality on Rio Tinto’s Parker Point Stage 2 Wharf Pile Structural Integrity Scope Project when a Vertech employee was within 100mm of being decapitated by 350kg of chain which had projected from a vessel below the affected worker. 
This incident was not reported to Rio Tinto, Worksafe or IRATA and the employee who reported the incident to the Vertech XXX plus Vertech’s XXX Manager and to Vertech’s XXX Manager, was subsequently terminated by Vertech.
The day prior to the near fatality (02 May 2025), the Parker Point shiploader hit one of the air compressors being used by the Vertech Rope Access Technicians. 
The air compressor door which had been left open was destroyed, making it unsafe to use. 
The job should have been stopped at this point to ensure proper planning so that all further tasks could be completed safety.
On the day of the near fatality (03 May 2025), Vertech had to get air to the 750 kg air hoists to complete the rigging task. 
There was no lift plan to lift the air hoists out of the vessel which was also being used to double up as Rio Tinto’s FRC, but Vertech went ahead with the lift anyway. 
Because there were no airlines long enough to reach due to the compressor being damaged and unserviceable, Vertech decided to lift the block head with a rope access sling so they could complete the task. 
Rope access slings should never be mixed with rigging equipment. When Vertech commenced lifting the block head, it created a loop of stored energy in the excess chain. 
This suddenly let go and the remainder of the 350kg chain flew out of the vessel, missing the head of a Vertech Rope Access Technician by 100mm.
The Union is appalled to find that the near fatality at Paker Point was not reported to Rio Tinto or any of the regulatory authorities. 
The Offshore Alliance is seeking an urgent investigation of this incident by Worksafe WA and can provide the details of personnel willing to speak to Worksafe about the incident.
There are numerous other incidents leading up to the near-fatality which had not been reported by Vertech to Rio Tinto and the Offshore Alliance has ongoing concerns for the health and safety of all workers employed on the Parker Point Stage 2 Wharf Pile Structural Integrity Scope Project.

In bargaining with Qube last year on behalf of our Prelude logistics members, the Offshore Alliance served Qube with a claim for a 55% increase in wages, along with improved employment conditions.
The reason for our claim was very clear. 
55% is close to the wage cuts which were ripped off Prelude Stores and MLC workers when Shell sacked their logistics workforce in 2021-22 and brought in Qube Offshore on low-wage common law contracts.
To the credit of our Prelude Logistics members, they got organised and took the fight up to Qube with 4 months of Protected Industrial Action, late last year and into early 2025.
This dispute cost Qube several hundred thousand dollars in additional costs in their efforts to use untrained scab labour, and cost Shell a shitload more in lost productivity and delayed projects.
Commencing next Monday, the Offshore Alliance have a 3-day Hearing before the Fair Work Commission where we are seeking a Determination from the Commission requiring Qube to pay OA members the pay claims we are seeking for our Qube Offshore members.
The Offshore Alliance has one of the country’s best industrial barristers (Phil Boncardo) running our case, ably supported by OA lawyer Jess Duane.
Our union will never back away from taking the fight up to employers on the job and in the Courts to improve the pay and conditions of our members.

Despite the new EBA being a Greenfield Agreement, our members had full involvement in the development of our log of claims, the negotiation of the Agreement and the agreed bargaining outcomes.

After months and months of denial by Chevron about their intention to sack hundreds of Australian engineers and replace them with cheap exploited labour from India, they have now announced the loss of 300-400 jobs.
Chevron are an absolute disgrace and they have demonstrated complete contempt for their highly skilled West Australian workforce in Elizabeth Quay (and we aren't talking about their HR bosses in this statement).
-------------------------
Article written by Matt McKenzie and published in the West Australian
American oil and gas giant Chevron is wielding the axe on hundreds of WA jobs after months of speculation.
There will be two waves of redundancies in the Australian operations, with the first group of staff notified in the past two weeks. They will exit on July 31.
A second wave will follow later in the September quarter and has not yet been finalised.
Chevron’s Australian operations are headquartered in Perth and the company runs the giant Gorgon and Wheatstone gas export plants in the Pilbara.
It was among the largest foreign investors into WA’s resources industry, and the business earned $17 billion of revenue in 2024. Profit was $US5.2b ($9bn).
The company had already signalled plans to cut about 15 to 20 per cent of its global staff — and it is broadly expected a similar slice of the 2000-strong Australian workforce will be on the chopping block.
That would be about 300 to 400 jobs across the two redundancy waves.
A spokesman for Chevron said the business was “taking action to simplify our organisational structure, execute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness”.
The business is chasing $US2b ($3b) to $US3b of structural cost cuts by the end of next year.
“In line with these goals, changes to our organisational structure are being made, and these are likely to result in a reduction of 15 to 20 per cent in our global workforce, including a reduction to our Australian workforce,” he said.
“Our priority is to support our employees through this process with respect and care. We will seek to redeploy people within the company where possible, and we will provide severance and career transition services when required.”
The West Australian first reported the looming job losses in November last year when former chief Mark Hatfield confirmed the company’s workforce was under review.
He said no final decisions had been made at the time.
That was in addition to an international process which was to consider moving jobs to a “global capability centre” offshore in the Indian city of Bangalore.

Earlier this week Paid Parental Leave increased to 24 weeks 🎉
Thanks to legislation passed by the Federal Labor Government in 2023, Paid Parental Leave has been gradually rising - from 18 weeks to a full 26 weeks by 2026.
This milestone wouldn’t be possible without the advocacy of Union movement, who’ve long championed better entitlements for working parents across Australia. 💪

China is the major customer for most of Australia’s iron ore, and It’s good to see the federal government actually doing something to help the long-term future of the Australian iron ore industry.
The job security of over 140K workers is directly tied to the iron ore industry, and governments at all levels must be proactive in supporting it!
But this doesn't need to come at the expense of our net zero targets. A Future Made in Australia means more jobs for blue-collar workers as we invest in new technologies - which need green steel and critical minerals mined right here in Australia.
PM Anthony Albanese explains that Australia's trading relationship with China can and must continue to thrive: “As both countries co-operate to advance decarbonisation, we also need to work together to address global excess steel capacity."
WMWA and our partner unions will always back in governments when they support the future of the industry, and we'll continue to advocate for our members to make sure your voices are heard!

The difference between Ulan Underground and Ulan West? 
About 2kms, and almost 12% in pay.
MEU members at Ulan Underground near Mudgee have just launched 24-hours of strike action in pursuit of pay parity with their sister mine, the nearby Ulan West. Workers at Ulan Underground currently receive almost 12% less than at Ulan West, despite both being employed by Glencore, and performing the same roles.
Ulan Underground workers generate billions of dollars in profit for Glencore, and yet the company is resisting lifting their pay to the base rate at Ulan West. That's millions of dollars should be flowing back to the community which hosts the mines, but is instead being diverted for overseas shareholders. 
We're fed up. Glencore needs to get serious and return to the bargaining table with a fair and reasonable offer, which recognises the value of the Ulan workforce and shows respect to the community.

In a newly released decision, the MEU has won our Same Job Same Pay application covering Workpac labour hire mine workers at Daunia and Blackwater!
When the order comes into effect, 120 labour hire workers will have their pay lifted in line with direct Whitehaven employees at the pits - an average of approximately $15,000 a year!
This decision quickly followed the long-awaited BHP OS Same Job Same Pay claim, in which the MEU was also successful.
The momentum is real, and it's in favour of ending the labour hire rort for good!

There is a long history of the Australian Government and multinational oil and gas companies screwing over the people of Timor Leste. 
In 2004 the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) unlawfully planted listening devices in the Cabinet Rooms of the Timor Leste Government, to give the Australian Government the upper hand in the negotiation of international sea boundaries between Australia and Timor Leste.
This was all so the Howard Government could help their mates from Woodside, Conoco Phillips, Shell and Osaka Gas, and assist them to get their hands on the Sunrise gas reserves and prevent the construction of an onshore gas processing plant in Timor Leste.
Fast forward 20 years and there hasn’t been a peep out of Santos about how they are going to ensure the decommissioning of their Bayu Undan facility in East Timor if they flog Santos to UAE consortium ADNOC.
The decommissioning costs of Bayu Undan are estimated to be approximately $1 Billion.
From both an environmental and jobs perspective, Santos should not be allowed by the Australian Government to avoid its obligation to pay for the decommissioning of Bayu Undan.
Timor Leste is one of the poorest countries in the world, and there is zero chance of them having the ability to pick up the mess which Santos will almost inevitably leave behind if they cut and run.
The decommissioning of Bayu Undan gives Timor Leste workers genuine work and training opportunities – particularly if the conditions of sale of Santos by the Australian Government is for Santos to fund the decommissioning of Bayu Undan by using Timor Leste and Australian contractors, Timor Leste workers and trainees, and Australian workers where there is not sufficient skilled labour in Timor Leste.
The proposed Santos sale to a UAE outfit raises a whole stack of questions and the Federal Government cannot turn a blind eye to the need for Santos to set aside funds to pay for the decommissioning of Bayu Undan.

In 2021, the Chevron-Cleanaway outfits stripped $30,000 out of the annual pay packets of waste disposal crew at the Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities when Cleanaway took on the new Chevron contract.
Over the last 4 years, Chevron-Cleanaway have ripped $120K out of the bank accounts of Chevron’s waste disposal workforce in a big FU to workers who play a critical role in the productive operations of Chevron’s Australian oil and gas facilities.
All part of the Chevrong way of doing business in their rip, tear and bust approach to the working conditions of Australian oil and gas workers.
According to Chevron, paying workers a flat rate of just $48.63 for working and living more than half their lives away from home, is ok.
Taking penalty rates out of the mix, Chevron’s rubbish contractor of choice Cleanaway, are paying workers engaged on a major hazard facility, just $33.45 per hour - away from home and family.
Last year Chevron made a profit of $8 Billion from its West Australian operations.
Over the last 12 months, Chevron’s Cleanaway crew have signed up with the Offshore Alliance, rejected Cleanaway's non-union EA and are taking Protected Industrial Action.
This week, members stepped up PIA with a number of full day stoppages and are fighting back against Chevron’s insatiable corporate greed.
Our Cleanaway members have got plenty of ticker and will go one day longer and one day stronger than the Cleanaway and Chevron bosses in our fight for a Union EBA.
The Cleanaway crew across Chevron’s Gorgon and Wheatstone facility are to be commended for standing up to the big end of town.
Cleanaway’s pay rates are on par with the product being carted in the back of their trucks and our members are not going to back away or back down until we win.

In 2023, OA members working for Chevron across the Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities took extensive Protected Industrial Action in pushing back against Chevron’s baseline rubbish and in support of the Union’s fight for an industry standard EBA.
Which we ultimately secured by jamming up Chevron’s operations.
During the course of PIA, Chevron deducted monies from OA members which the Union and our lawyers believe was unlawful.
Late last year, the Offshore Alliance filed a prosecution against Chevron in the Federal Court, seeking Chevron re-pay the monies which the Union believe were unlawfully deducted, plus interest.
The Union is also seeking penalties be paid for Chevron for breaching the Fair Work Act.
Mediation in the Federal Court last month unsurprisingly failed to resolve our legal claims and the Federal Court are set to determine the matter in the back half of this year.
This dispute is not only of great significance to our Chevron matters.
Shell took similar action against our Prelude members during our 75 days of Protected Industrial Action in 2022 and the Federal Court’s decision in the Chevron prosecution will have a significant bearing on our long-standing and unresolved claims against Shell.
The wheels of justice turn relatively slowly, and litigation is rarely cheap, but litigation plays an important part in complementing the active industrial campaigns taken by OA members across our offshore and onshore facilities.
Through the backing and support of members however, the Offshore Alliance, is properly resourced to take on the big end of town in the Courts where necessary to ensure our members’ workplace rights are not compromised.

Over the past few months, Vertech Inspectors have been subject to threats and intimidation by an outfit which has danced to Woodside’s tune by refusing to negotiate fair pay and conditions with the Offshore Alliance and our members.
There is no doubt that Woodside sit behind Vertech’s bargaining approach and are driving an agenda of low wage outcomes across its offshore and onshore facilities.
The Union is aware that Woodside are demanding Vertech have an EA which undermines industry standards – an outcome which will trigger a race to the bottom.
The likes of INPEX aren’t helping either by promoting a scab labour force to try and undermine standards on the INPEX offshore facilities.
All Inspectors not working for Vertech are encouraged to reject any job offers being made for Turnaround work on the INPEX facilities.
We have an opportunity to sort out good rates and conditions for Inspectors for the next 4 years and the OA is encouraging all Inspectors to lock in behind the Vertech Inspectors fight for fair industrial outcomes.
Protected Industrial Action is continuing across all Vertech sites and facilities.

Great work by the Mining and Energy Union in driving the agenda for Same Job Same Pay legislation, and lawyering up against BHP to ensure workers employed in what are essentially labour hire roles, are paid the same as the host employer.
The Offshore Alliance currently has one SJSP application before the FWC and another to be filed shortly.
Our lawyers will be reviewing the new Case Law coming out of the BHP SJSP Decision with a view to this being rolled out to every site and facility where members are being engaged in labour hire type roles.
Even where the labour hire role is being performed under the guise of a 'service provider' - as was the case by BHP's in-house entity, O/S.
The MEU is to be commended for leading the way in securing workplace laws which will help eliminate the scourge of exploitative labour hire arrangements on major resource projects.

The Kuiper maintenance EBA has the best offshore casual maintenance rates on the West Coast, with the new EBA delivering improvements in the Night Shift Loading, Offshore Allowance, Travel, Dual Trade and Electrical Allowances and Income Protection.

Power Down Under sparkies working on the Alkimos Desalination Project have had enough of uncertainty — they’ve filed a petition with the ETU for a site-specific Enterprise Agreement and we’ve officially applied to the Fair Work Commission for a Majority Support Determination.
This is one of WA’s biggest public infrastructure projects in decades — and our members are making sure they're not left behind. 💪
Currently, contractors without a deal worth more than $1 million don’t have to match Acciona’s site rates — but we’re not leaving anything to chance. Our members are demanding to lock in the gold standard:
💰 $57.48/hr
📍 $4.50 Site Allowance
🛠 $19/week Tool Allowance
🚗 $40/day Travel Allowance
🛡 $2200/week Income Protection
✊ $110/week Severance Pay
We’re fighting to lock in security, certainty, and the best rates in Perth.

Before the bosses even hit “snooze” on their alarms, Schindler members were already out on the lawn — freezing their butts off, footys in hand, and sausages sizzling on the barbie.
In the pre-dawn chill, the playlist was pumping, the smell of democracy was in the air, and morale was higher than a boss’s bonus.
As management started rolling in — soy lattes in hand and confusion on their faces — they were met with a sight more powerful than any memo: a united crew ready to stand their ground… and maybe offer a snag if you're lucky.
Even the GM couldn’t resist the smoky lure of union solidarity and wandered out like a moth to a flame. Or maybe just to get a sausage. Either way — 𝐰𝐞 𝐠𝐨𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.

This is a pay rise for 20% of Australia's workforce - over 2 million workers across the country. This pay increase wasn't decided by the bosses. Every year, the union movement fights for a fair increase that ensures workers' wages keep up with the cost of living while business groups try to force wages down.

From 1 July, the Superannuation Guarantee increases to 12%, which means your employer must pay 12% of your ordinary earnings into your nominated super account at least every three months.
It was unions that first won super for every worker back in the 1980s, and ever since we've fought to defend and strengthen your access to super, so you can have a comfortable and dignified retirement after a lifetime of work.
EVERY worker in Australia is entitled to superannuation, including migrant and visa workers, so please check your super account every quarter to make sure you're being paid fairly! And if you're not being paid your super, please reach out to your delegate or organiser.

WMWA won't be giving up our Fight for Fair, and our members are more determined than ever to hold Rio to account!

Over the past few months, Vertech Inspectors have been subject to threats and intimidation by an outfit which has danced to Woodside’s tune by refusing to negotiate fair pay and conditions with the Offshore Alliance and our members.
There is no doubt that Woodside sit behind Vertech’s bargaining approach and are driving an agenda of low wage outcomes across its offshore and onshore facilities.
The Union is aware that Woodside are demanding Vertech have an EA which undermines industry standards – an outcome which will trigger a race to the bottom.
The likes of INPEX aren’t helping either by promoting a scab labour force to try and undermine standards on the INPEX offshore facilities.
All Inspectors not working for Vertech are encouraged to reject any job offers being made for Turnaround work on the INPEX facilities.
We have an opportunity to sort out good rates and conditions for Inspectors for the next 4 years and the OA is encouraging all Inspectors to lock in behind the Vertech Inspectors fight for fair industrial outcomes.
Protected Industrial Action is continuing across all Vertech sites and facilities.

The decommissioning of Australian offshore oil and gas facilities should not oil and gas operators or State and Federal Governments taking short cuts. 
This includes not compromising on the health and safety of workers, the pay or conditions or ensuring that all decommissioning work performed in the decommissioning of Australian oil and gas facilities and associated infrastructure should be done by Australian workers.
And it all started with Woodside’s dodgy deal with NOGA.
The Energy News Bulletin Report (by Russell Yeo) on the Northern Endeavour FPSO is another woeful chapter in the debacle of the decommissioning of this facility.
----------------------
Something is Rotting in the State of Denmark: Govt's decision to send the Northern Endeavour FPSO to Scandinavia for decommissioning causes stink
The lack of decommissioning facilities and expertise in the Australian maritime and energy sectors has been laid bare today with the announcement that the Northern Endeavour floating production storage and offtake vessel (FPSO) will be towed to Denmark to be dismantled. 
While the decision has been described by the federal government as the best option to meet its aims, it also shows the lack of expertise in this increasingly important sector. 
"We contracted MARS following a global, competitive open tender...MARS best met the government's aims for this important decommissioning work after a global, competitive, open tender," they added.  
Under the contract, MARS will recycle the FPSO and manage the waste streams, including hazardous waste. 
The government said the priority is for MARS to complete the work to high safety and environmental standards and meet all Australian and international requirements. 
As part of the plan COSCO Shipping Heavy Transport will dry tow the FPSO to Denmark using their semi-submersible heavy transport vessel, the Hua Rui Long where MARS complete the recycling at its ship recycling facility in Frederikshavn. 
While the government's statement proclaims:"There are no purpose-built facilities in Australia equipped to recycle a vessel as large and complex as the Northern Endeavour FPSO," predictably, the unions representing workers who could have benefitted from this significant body of work aren't happy.  
Paul Farrow, the national secretary of the Australian Workers' Union said: 
"It is deeply disappointing to see the government considering shipping the Northern Endeavour overseas rather than harnessing this opportunity to support local industries and workers. 
Decommissioning offshore facilities domestically isn't just about preserving jobs—it's about creating new ones and bolstering our steel manufacturing capabilities. 
"We strongly urge the government to reconsider this proposal. 
The Northern Endeavour and other decommissioned facilities represent not just environmental responsibility, but an important economic opportunity for Australian industry and communities." 
An unnamed Maritime Union of Australia leader said they were of the opinion that Australia does have the capacity for recycling the Northern Endeavour domestically, but that the government's "extremely narrow" procurement policy left brought the Danish out on top.  
"Going for the bottom line, without any consideration of what it would mean for the generation of local economies and workforce capacity. Northern Endeavour aside, we still need to handle the remaining six million tonnes of infrastructure to come ashore," said the source.
"We've known this task was coming for some time, yet the department are sitting on their hands rather than mobilising a whole of government approach for both the offshore and shoreside components of decommissioning. 
"The workforce is ready, the local businesses want the work, what's expected from government is the industrial development and leadership that they have been talking up for several years now,' they added. 
The need for investment in Australia's decommissioning capabilities has been on the government's radar for some time. 
The ALP National Platform from August 2023 states:
 "Labor will establish an Australian decommissioning industry...Labor will work with industry to establish shared infrastructure requirements such as membrane-protected yards and vessels to carry out decommissioning, dismantling and recycling works." 
And in September of the same year the resources minister Madeleine King told 
parliament: 
"As industry starts investing to decommission $60 billion in offshore infrastructure, we want as much of that investment to be spent backing Australian industry and Australian jobs." 
The following month Macquarie University released a report calling for dedicated sites to handle Australia's emerging decommissioning industry, with academics and policy experts warning of a looming shortfall in onshore dismantling infrastructure—particularly in WA—and recommended investment to develop domestic ports, yards and recycling capacity.  
But despite these proclamations little has been done, with the MUA calling for the Laminaria-Corallina Levy - established by the government in the wake of the Northern Endeavour debacle – to be reinvested into building domestic dismantling infrastructure—starting with a dedicated decommissioning marine terminal in Western Australia. 
The industry levy was designed to recover the public costs of decommissioning infrastructure abandoned by industry. 
With up to $1 billion to be collected from offshore oil and gas operators, the union say the fund is well placed to support investment in sovereign capacity that prevents further regulatory failures. 
The MUA's national assistant secretary Thomas Mayo said "The levy was created because industry has shirked its responsibility.
The best use of those funds is to build the very infrastructure that ensures this never happens again." 
"This is a chance for the government to turn a failure into a foundation. Public money should build public benefit—not subsidise foreign shipbreakers". 
"This should have been the cornerstone of a new era of green manufacturing in Australia, we should be feeding that steel into an Australian electric arc furnace, not shipping it to Scandinavia on a foreign-flagged vessel." 
MUA National Secretary Paddy Crumlin said, "Towing the Northern Endeavour to Norway for dismantling is not just an absurd outsourcing of jobs—it's a 15,000-nautical-mile climate contradiction. 
By the time it gets there, we'll have burned more fuel hauling steel across oceans than it would take to recycle it here at home. 
"The ALP's own platform commits to establishing a domestic decommissioning industry that secures local jobs and ensures world-class environmental standards. 
Yet here we are exporting a prime opportunity to do just that." 
The outsourcing of the decom work highlights the work being undertaken by the Centre of Decommissioning Australia (CODA), established in 2021 to increase domestic capability.  
CODA's CEO Francis Norman said while the decision highlights the future opportunity for Australia, it also flags the need for the country to continue to evaluate and where appropriate upgrade its port facilities to capture as much work as possible in the future.  
"We can see this beginning to happen in Gippsland where Esso are preparing the Barry Beach facility to receive their structures in 2027/28 and in WA at Onslow and Ashburton. 
"We know that in coming years we will see a steady increase in the removal of large, fixed structures, particularly off Western Australia.  
"These would typically be easier to manage into Australian ports than floating platforms such as the Northern Endeavour and several of our existing ports could be reasonably economically modified to accommodate this work." 
 Shane McWhinney from the Northern Endeavour team at DISR, said: "The government's drivers - perhaps obviously, perhaps not - are a little bit different to industry's.  
 "We're not just looking to deliver this decommissioning program in the cheapest possible fashion. The government was quite clear all the way through that the number one priority they had was safety of people and protecting the environment. And if that was going to cost a bit more, that's fine."

In 2023, OA members working for Chevron across the Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities took extensive Protected Industrial Action in pushing back against Chevron’s baseline rubbish and in support of the Union’s fight for an industry standard EBA.
Which we ultimately secured by jamming up Chevron’s operations.
During the course of PIA, Chevron deducted monies from OA members which the Union and our lawyers believe was unlawful.
Late last year, the Offshore Alliance filed a prosecution against Chevron in the Federal Court, seeking Chevron re-pay the monies which the Union believe were unlawfully deducted, plus interest.
The Union is also seeking penalties be paid for Chevron for breaching the Fair Work Act.
Mediation in the Federal Court last month unsurprisingly failed to resolve our legal claims and the Federal Court are set to determine the matter in the back half of this year.
This dispute is not only of great significance to our Chevron matters.
Shell took similar action against our Prelude members during our 75 days of Protected Industrial Action in 2022 and the Federal Court’s decision in the Chevron prosecution will have a significant bearing on our long-standing and unresolved claims against Shell.
The wheels of justice turn relatively slowly, and litigation is rarely cheap, but litigation plays an important part in complementing the active industrial campaigns taken by OA members across our offshore and onshore facilities.
Through the backing and support of members however, the Offshore Alliance, is properly resourced to take on the big end of town in the Courts where necessary to ensure our members’ workplace rights are not compromised.

In 2021, the Chevron-Cleanaway outfits stripped $30,000 out of the annual pay packets of waste disposal crew at the Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities when Cleanaway took on the new Chevron contract.
Over the last 4 years, Chevron-Cleanaway have ripped $120K out of the bank accounts of Chevron’s waste disposal workforce in a big FU to workers who play a critical role in the productive operations of Chevron’s Australian oil and gas facilities.
All part of the Chevrong way of doing business in their rip, tear and bust approach to the working conditions of Australian oil and gas workers.
According to Chevron, paying workers a flat rate of just $48.63 for working and living more than half their lives away from home, is ok.
Taking penalty rates out of the mix, Chevron’s rubbish contractor of choice Cleanaway, are paying workers engaged on a major hazard facility, just $33.45 per hour - away from home and family.
Last year Chevron made a profit of $8 Billion from its West Australian operations.
Over the last 12 months, Chevron’s Cleanaway crew have signed up with the Offshore Alliance, rejected Cleanaway's non-union EA and are taking Protected Industrial Action.
This week, members stepped up PIA with a number of full day stoppages and are fighting back against Chevron’s insatiable corporate greed.
Our Cleanaway members have got plenty of ticker and will go one day longer and one day stronger than the Cleanaway and Chevron bosses in our fight for a Union EBA.
The Cleanaway crew across Chevron’s Gorgon and Wheatstone facility are to be commended for standing up to the big end of town.
Cleanaway’s pay rates are on par with the product being carted in the back of their trucks and our members are not going to back away or back down until we win.

There is a long history of the Australian Government and multinational oil and gas companies screwing over the people of Timor Leste. 
In 2004 the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) unlawfully planted listening devices in the Cabinet Rooms of the Timor Leste Government, to give the Australian Government the upper hand in the negotiation of international sea boundaries between Australia and Timor Leste.
This was all so the Howard Government could help their mates from Woodside, Conoco Phillips, Shell and Osaka Gas, and assist them to get their hands on the Sunrise gas reserves and prevent the construction of an onshore gas processing plant in Timor Leste.
Fast forward 20 years and there hasn’t been a peep out of Santos about how they are going to ensure the decommissioning of their Bayu Undan facility in East Timor if they flog Santos to UAE consortium ADNOC.
The decommissioning costs of Bayu Undan are estimated to be approximately $1 Billion.
From both an environmental and jobs perspective, Santos should not be allowed by the Australian Government to avoid its obligation to pay for the decommissioning of Bayu Undan.
Timor Leste is one of the poorest countries in the world, and there is zero chance of them having the ability to pick up the mess which Santos will almost inevitably leave behind if they cut and run.
The decommissioning of Bayu Undan gives Timor Leste workers genuine work and training opportunities – particularly if the conditions of sale of Santos by the Australian Government is for Santos to fund the decommissioning of Bayu Undan by using Timor Leste and Australian contractors, Timor Leste workers and trainees, and Australian workers where there is not sufficient skilled labour in Timor Leste.
The proposed Santos sale to a UAE outfit raises a whole stack of questions and the Federal Government cannot turn a blind eye to the need for Santos to set aside funds to pay for the decommissioning of Bayu Undan.

The Oceanic Engineering Services (OES) HVAC crew are the lowest paid maintenance contractor working on the Prelude FLNG. By a long shot.
Last week, OES advised the Offshore Alliance that they did not agree to commence bargaining for an EBA to cover the Prelude HVAC crew.
OES have been sent formal legal notice by the Offshore Alliance advising that unless the Company agrees to commence bargaining by COB today, the Union will file a Majority Support Determination (MSD) application in the FWC to force the Company to the bargaining table.
The negotiation of Union-standard EBA’s is a workplace right!

Good news. After being told last week by Oceania Engineering that they didn’t want to bargain for an EBA for our HVAC members on Prelude, they have changed their mind and are now keen to bargain.
Maybe “keen” isn’t quite the right word, but they will be now be sitting down at the bargaining table.
For reasons unknown at our end, Oceania Engineering weren’t too happy with yesterday’s Facebook Post and wanted it taken down.
Fortunately, Oceania Engineering don’t run our Facebook Page and the Post remains up.

Legeneering’s bargaining position is to rip apart industry standards at every level, and there is zero chance of OA members copping a 10% reduction in Hook Up and Commission rates.
With OA membership being 100% in all maintenance trades and disciplines, OA Legeneering members on the Woodside FPSO’s have locked into our claims for industry standard rates and accommodation across Legeneering's offshore maintenance & HUC work scopes.

On 26 June 2025, Powertech made application to the Fair Work Commission for approval of an EBA which has starting flat rates of pay of just $28.27 per hour – for working up to 84 hours per week.
Powertech’s dodgy Agreement really steps up however in setting out the flat hourly rate for Trade Technicians working on INPEX, Chevron and Santos offshore facilities - $65 per hour flat rates for working on offshore maintenance, Hook-Up and Commissioning and Construction projects.
And $56 per hour flat rates (for 84-hour weeks) if you are working on Chevron's Gorgon facility.
It’s as dodgy as it gets.
This week, the Offshore Alliance lawyers filed an application with FWC to oppose the approval of the Powertech Agreement on the following grounds:
1. The Proposed Agreement was not genuinely agreed;
2. The Powertech employees who participated in the Ballot included workers who are outside of the scope of the proposed agreement;
3. The Powertech employees who were asked to vote on the proposed agreement included workers who did not have sufficient interest in the terms of the agreement;
4. Powertech’s Proposed Agreement does not pass the Better Off Overall Test (BOOT).
The Offshore Alliance will continue to put resources into our legal opposition to the approval of dodgy Enterprise Agreements which don’t comply with the Fair Work Act and undermine established industry standards.
We will keep our Powertech members updated on our challenge to their vile Enterprise Agreement.

Woodside are doing their best to overtake Chevron as the worst oil and gas Operator on the Australian coast. 
Whilst the Offshore Alliance backed in Woodside's Scarborough Project and will provide the same support for Browse getting Federal Government approval, we will be fighting Woodside at every level to ensure our contractor membership get good EBA outcomes on Woodside’s offshore and onshore facilities.
Woodside are demanding contractors cap wages at 2.5% per annum for the next 4 years.
There is zero chance of the Offshore Alliance copping dud deals so that Woodside can line its pockets at the expense of the very workers who generate Woodside their multi-billion dollar profits each year.
In 2024, Woodside increased its after tax profit by 115% to over $3.5 Billion.
Yet Woodside’s thanks to its contractor workforce is to give them a big FU by capping wages.
Our offshore maintenance members have been copping a dud deal by Woodside since 2017 and are getting ready to give Woodside a decent belt to secure industry standard EBA’s.
And the same goes for our members at KGP and Pluto as there is zero chance of them being muzzled by Woodside’s HR bosses.
The biggest pay anomaly of the lot is at Pluto 2 where Woodside secured a 30% discount on wages in their sub-standard 4-year Greenfield Agreement in 2021 and doubled down by paying workers 10 hours pay per day despite spending 12 hours in work and travel, door to door.
The Offshore Alliance and our members are ready for extensive industrial action across all Woodside facilities should corporate greed get in the way of fair industrial outcomes over the next 18 months.

First Rio said times were too tough to negotiate better wages for workers in Paraburdoo - then in June announced a $2.5 BILLION expansion at HDI.
Only last month Rio senior management have been in the Pilbara saying the future of iron ore in the Pilbara is soooo uncertain, they can't commit to long-term job security given that Unions are now back in the Pilbara. Given this announcement that Rio is actually planning to be in the Pilbara to 2115 - it's no wonder their workforce don't trust their management team.

We're flushed with anger. We simply can’t hold it any longer! BHP might think they can paper over the cracks, but members are done taking this sitting down. 
Behind the glossy reports and media releases about BHPs successful gender balancing recruitment strategies, MEU members working as train crew in the Pilbara have been raising a simple, basic issue for more than 12 months: THE TOILETS.
For train crew working long shifts, waiting for trains, or operating in shunt yards, the available facilities are often inadequate, impractical, or in some cases, entirely absent. While this issue disproportionately affects women for a range of reasons, these pisspoor facilities impact all workers.
The toilets pictured look alright though!  Those are the loos on one level of BHP's Brisbane office and the reception and basement ones in the Melbourne head offices.
This is an issue of safety, dignity, and respect and it’s one BHP should have fixed yesterday.

Here at the ETU, we’ve just seen another steaming pile of a “baseline agreement” lobbed into the FWC - this time from Civmec, offering a grand total of $𝟑𝟑.𝟑𝟓/𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐫 for an electrician. That’s not a wage, it’s a joke - and we’re not laughing.
Who’s voting these garbage deals up? Usually non-sparkies or casuals on flat rates, who don’t even realise they’re signing everyone else over to the poverty line. And here's the kicker - 𝐲𝐨𝐮’𝐫𝐞 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐭𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐲 𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐬. Yep. Even if the agreement says you’ll get 2% a year, and your flat rate is better, you get 𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠. Zilch. Nada. Why? Because when the EA ends, you'll be on $34.49/hr while they’re still pocketing the same flat rate. They just sold you a pay freeze dressed up as a "deal".
But wait - it gets shadier.
The new 𝐂.𝐂.𝐄 𝐏𝐭𝐲 𝐋𝐭𝐝 𝐄𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐀𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟓 now explicitly excludes maintenance sparkies at:
➡️Alcoa

If you work maintenance on one of these sites and haven’t spoken to the ETU yet, 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐨𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐢𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲. Civmec is in the middle of bargaining, and trust us - they’re trying to stitch you up 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐬𝐨 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐚𝐬 𝐚 𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐲 𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥, 𝐨𝐫 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐚 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐩 𝐛𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐞.

👊 It’s time to push back. Civmec and companies like them will pay as little as they can get away with - and unless we organise, they'll keep getting away with it.

The ink is only just dry on Saipem’s commitment to never, ever f*** up a job as badly as what they did when they brought the Castorone onto the Scarborough Pipelay project. 
They promised to do better but somewhere between the efforts of Chevron and Saipem, they’re about to ensure that the Jansz project is another mismanaged project where expediency and profit are prioritized over safety and Australian jobs.
According to our Chevron sources (and there are plenty in light of Chevron's attack on their Elizabeth Quay workforce), Saipem are wanting to use foreign visa workers to fill a key ROV position on Chevron's Jansz Project – the Senior Pilot/Technician role.
Chevron and Saipem want to use foreign Pilot Technicians who have SFA experience in operating the Schilling HD work-class ROV system — the system deployed for this complex deepwater subsea construction campaign.
Under IMCA C 005 – Guidance on Competence Assurance and Assessment for Remote Systems & ROV Division, the internationally recognised standard for safe and competent offshore ROV operations, the minimum recommended crewing structure requires a three-tier hierarchy:
1. ROV Supervisor (R03)
2. Senior Pilot/Technician (R02)
3. Pilot Technician (R01)
The exclusion of the R02 role is not only inconsistent with IMCA best practices, but also introduces serious operational and legal risks, including:
• A lack of technical redundancy during critical operations.
• Supervisor overload and increased risk of error or incident.
• Reduced capacity to troubleshoot, especially during 24/7 operations.
• Inadequate support and mentoring for junior or inexperienced crew.
• Elevated exposure to environmental, safety, and reputational risks.
The Senior Pilot/Technician position should be filled by an experienced, qualified and technically competent Australian technician.
We won’t be copping Chevron/Saipem rorting Australian visa laws and putting the health and safety of offshore construction workers at risk.
Australian jobs must come first.

Over the last 3 years, the Offshore Alliance has filed numerous Reports with NOPSEMA about Woodside’s shortcomings across their offshore construction and decommissioning projects. 
The likes of McDermott and Subsea 7 have adopted a rip and bust approach on the Woodside projects as Woodside’s safety has deteriorated to its worst standards in over 30 years.
It is great to see NOPSEMA hold Woodside to account and make clear to Woodside that their OHS standards are unacceptable.
The Boiling Cold article (in the attached link) is another good piece of investigative journalism and shows how low Woodside’s safety standards have fallen.
Decommissioning work is going to be a key work front for our members over the coming decades, and it is important that good industrial and OH&S standards (which go hand in hand), plus the use of Australian oil and gas workers, are non-negotiables in setting our future decom standards.

Powertech, who are currently working on the Chevron, Santos and INPEX facilities are seeking approval in the FWC of a Baseline Agreement which pays licensed tradespersons working in the oil and gas industry, flat rates of pay of just $56 per hour.
It’s completely off tap and in no-way reflective of trade rates of pay in our industry.
On non-oil and gas facilities, Powertech want to pay workers as little as $28 per hour – Flat.
Every Powertech employment standard in their proposed EA is baseline rubbish and unacceptable rates and conditions for oil and gas workers.
The Offshore Alliance have lawyered up and are opposing the Powertech Baseline Agreement on the following grounds:
1. The agreement was not genuinely agreed to by employees;
2. Workers outside the scope of the proposed agreement were allowed to vote;
3. Some who voted did not have a sufficient interest in the agreement’s terms;
4. Powertech failed to meet its obligations under s180(5) of the Fair Work Act;
5. The agreement fails the BOOT (Better Off Overall Test).
There is no place for dodgy Baseline Agreements in our industry.
The OA legal team have knocked out 15 dodgy Baseline Agreements in legal appeals and challenges in the FWC against the approval of Baseline Agreements which don’t comply with the process and or standards required in the Fair Work Act.
Industrially, the OA have smashed up another 45 Baseline Agreements and replaced them with genuinely negotiated Union EBA’s.
The Fair Work Commission have listed the Hearing of the Powertech Baseline Agreement on 5th September 2025.
The Offshore Alliance will fight both industrially and legally for proper industrial standards to apply across our onshore and offshore oil and gas facilities.
IF YOU DON’T FIGHT, YOU LOSE

After two EA meetings with the company, it has become increasingly clear that they are more interested in pointing the finger at every other inshore operator instead of focusing on the claims of their workforce. 
With twenty-seven claims submitted ranging from increased Wages, North West Allowance, decreased flexibility, new allowances and aligning conditions with their Offshore counterparts, the company has already rejected at least half of the claims with the remainder under consideration. 
Having seen the rates that the company charge their clients for Inshore work, they are clearly doing alright for themselves in the North West.
One of the key issues we will be seeking to iron out through this process is a clear delineation between Inshore & Offshore work and that crew get paid Offshore wages & conditions when in engaged in Offshore Oil & Gas operations, as it appears the company are charging clients a higher rate for this work but paying the crew subpar inshore rates of pay.
Regardless of the company rejecting a number of claims, we will continue to press our points until we get an outcome that meets our interests!

MUA Members at Teekay Shipping Vote Almost Unanimously for Protected Industrial Action on Defence Vessels
Yesterday, MUA members employed by Teekay Shipping voted almost unanimously in favour of protected industrial action, with an extraordinary 98% ballot outcome in favour of taking action.
Teekay, operating a diverse fleet of ships in Australian waters, providing maritime logistics to international energy producers, refiners, and importers as well as the Australian Government.
In a highly profitable and lucrative commercial environment for Teekay’s shareholders, MUA members have continued to raise concerns about their pay and conditions being way out of whack with other operators in the Australian maritime sector, especially once the highly specialised skillsets and work of Teekay’s crews are factored into the equation.
Two substandard offers have been put on the table by Teekay but the workforce has rejected these and is insisting on a fleetwide agreement that includes all workers across all Teekay vessels.
Despite repeated union efforts, company negotiators have consistently refused to engage in meaningful dialogue on pay increases or improvements to critical employment conditions.
MUA members have made it clear that without serious progress at the negotiation table in the following weeks, they are ready to belt Teekay to secure a fair and consistent wage outcome across the fleet.
United We Stand!

In early 2027, eight WA inshore dive EA’s are set to expire, so we will soon look to start building a log of claims for the next round of negotiations.
One of the biggest issues in the dive sector has been the large gap between Inshore and Offshore wages.  Whilst the Offshore wages are great, the work has been scarce, so there has been considerable effort over the past few years to bring the Inshore up to a livable wage. 
Now that we have laid the groundwork, the next step will be to lift the rates a good deal higher. 
Diving is a niche industry and should be a high paying well respected job. 
Somewhere along the lines, this was forgotten about and only a few years ago we had Inshore Divers working for as little $520 for a 12-hour shift, while Inshore deckhands in the North West sat on around $800 a day.  We have since bridged that gap, but we need to continue to try and bridge the gap between inshore and offshore wages. 
One must never forget, it’s not a worker’s skillset or tickets that make a job well paid, it’s our capacity to be organised as a workforce that creates the ability to negotiate and extract higher wages from employers. That's what makes a job well paid! 
We need ALL Divers to remain focused on the next Inshore Dive Campaign.
We will seek to kick off a campaign in early 2026 to continue to lift the wages and conditions of the Divers in the inshore sector.  With their wages now sitting around 40% above Award, we will continue to drive this up to solidify Inshore Diving as the well-paid job it should be!

After several months of protracted EA negotiations, the MUA have filed a Protected Action Ballot Order against Pilbara Ports.
The MUA are currently bargaining for two replacement agreements across several locations in the Pilbara. With bargaining commencing at Port Hedland in November 2024 the company had come in with a fixed position not willing to budge or negotiate with their workforce as they continually blame the State Government and its Public Sector Wages Policy for the inability to reach agreement.
“In our meetings we continue to see the Pilbara Port Authority blame the State Government for an inability to reach agreement. They cry poor in negotiation meetings with the Union and say the complete opposite to the state government during recent state budget submissions,” said MUA North West Organiser Joel O’Brien. 
“Pilbara Ports achieving a record 775.7 million tonnes of exports/imports in FY 24/25 totalling $153 billion worth of commodities across the four ports, a net profit after tax of $246 million in FY 23/24, and providing state budget submissions that forecast almost a billion dollars in net profit over the next four years.”
“We find it incredibly hard to believe that they can’t meet our claims,” said Joel O’Brien. 
After months of refusing to respond to the Union’s claims, the MUA filed a bargaining dispute at the Fair Work Commission to seek to have Deputy President Binet attempt to mediate an outcome. This application was discontinued after the PPA refused to engage in any meaningful way.
In May 2025, the company put a non-union agreement out to vote in Port Hedland which received a majority No vote.
Instead of returning to the table to seek to fix the outstanding issues, the company pulled their offer off the table and put forward a second-rate offer that was worse than their first. We continue to see mixed messages about why they can’t reach agreement despite the impact it has on their own employees.
After the Union dismissed the company’s attempt to portray the Government as being the problem, the company filed their own bargaining dispute at the FWC. 
In preparation for this the Union put forward a proposal that met them on their own cost parameters, provided a number of improved conditions were met.
Several weeks later the MUA were still yet to receive a formal response to this position, prompting the membership to endorse filing a Protected Action Ballot Order.
This will cover the Utah Point Bulk Handling Facility in the first instance which will affect Atlas Iron and Mineral Resources Iron ore exports.
The MUA will also be filing for further Protected Industrial Action at Eastern Harbour in Port Hedland and Dampier Cargo Wharf which will affect a wide range of imports and exports, in Port Hedland and Dampier.
